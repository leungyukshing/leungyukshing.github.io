## Introduction

### Say hello World


It takes me about three hours to set up my personal blog here. This is my personal tech blog, where I will introduce some programming knowlegdes.
I have to admit that I am not a proficient or professional programmer. Instead, I am just a layman I suppose. So if there is any technical mistakes or problem, you're welcomed to comment or send an email to me. Your suggestions or comments will be highly valued.

### First programme

``` bash
//C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}

//C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   return 0;
}

```

Now you execute the program and you can see the text on your screen. It's a good begin. Now enjoy coding!
