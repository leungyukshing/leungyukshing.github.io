## Introduction
### Say hello World
This is my personal tech blog, where I will introduce some programming knowlegdes.
I have to admit that I am not a proficient or professional programmer. Instead, I am just a novice I suppose. So if there is any technical mistakes or problem, you're welcomed to comment or send an email to me. Your suggestions or comments will be highly valued.


### First programme

``` C++
//C version
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}


//C++ version
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   return 0;
}

```

Now you execute the program and you can see the text on your screen. It's simple but a good begin. Now enjoy coding!
